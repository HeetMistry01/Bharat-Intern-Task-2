# Bharat-Intern-Task-2: Movie Recommender

This repository contains a simple Movie Recommender model implemented using Python. The project follows a structured process, including data cleaning, model development, and the creation of a web-based user interface using streamlit.

Key Components:-

Data Cleaning: The model utilizes a dataset from Kaggle (TMDB Movies). The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, categorical data, and other preprocessing steps.

Model Development: The machine learning model is implemented. The trained model is saved for later use.

Streamlit Web Application: The project incorporates a Streamlit web application, providing a user-friendly interface for predicting movies. Users can input detail such as the name of the movie to receive a movie recommenders.
